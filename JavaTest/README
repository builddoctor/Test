There are no Eclipse or Intellij files checked in.  Just some source files that compile and run under an IDE.  You'll need JUnit version 4 to make the tests run.

If you're unsure about a build tool, you could use Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org) or Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org).  You can download the Junit library from http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads .
