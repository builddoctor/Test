Things you should know:

- there's no .sln files or any such thing like that.  There's just 2 source files.  Ordinarily you'd have 2 projects in the one solution: a Core project that contains the business code, and a Test project that contained the tests.  I didn't use Visual Studio to make this test code, so there was little point.

If you're unsure about the build tool to use, try NAnt.

You'll need an appropriate copy of NUnit to run the tests (see http://nunit.org/index.php?p=download).  You'll probably be fine with a .NET 2 DLL for NUnit. We can't tell you which one to choose because you get to choose versions of .NET to run.
The code does build and test under Mono.
