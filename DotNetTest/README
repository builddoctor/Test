Things you should know:

- there's no .sln files or any such thing like that.  There's just 2 source files.  Ordinarily you'd have projects in the one solution, but I didn't use Visual Studio to make this test code.

The code does build and test under Mono 1.0.

You'll need an appropriate copy of NUnit to run the tests.
